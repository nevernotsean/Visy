# TODO

- Fork Audio Level Tracker Script to track an audio source instead of microphone
- Scene01: Instead of Ripple deformer (in a circle) try a linear wave instead
- Scene01: Tween values so that waves travel across an area (instead of just amplitude)
- Scene02: Make the Tunnel move in random directions.
